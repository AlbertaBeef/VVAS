Embedded Platforms
#########################################


This section explains how to prepare Xilinx Embedded platforms for using the VVA SDK. First, you will start by installing the VVA package for a specific platform. This is followed by examples demonstrating the usage of VVA plugins to build solutions. Details about each plugin (such as properties, configuration, json files, etc.) are covered. 

This release supports Zynq Ultrascale+ MPSoc devices.
